This is only a practice run for developing microservices with GRPC.

Two microservices communicate with each other in the following project.

Recommendations and the MarketPlace

- Marketplace is a very simple web app that presents the user a list of books.
- Recommendations is a microservice that displays a list of books that the user might be interested in.

I produced an ExcailDraw file in which I described GRPC and its flow

DM me for the file, if you need it.

This repository is currently being worked on.

Please do:

```
prisma generate
prisma db push

```

- for generated client to access the database.

Updating docker soon
